## High-Level Design for Formal Verification (TLA+ Section)

This section captures the system's abstract behavior as a protocol/state-machine design suitable for TLA+ modeling. It focuses on correctness-critical concurrency, state, and failure modes — not implementation details.

**When to fill this section**: Before starting milestone implementation if the system involves concurrent actors, distributed state, ordering guarantees, resource ownership, or failure recovery. For simple CRUD systems with no concurrency concerns, mark `N/A` with a brief justification.

**Design guidance**: Omit low-level code, APIs, schemas, retries, logging, metrics, and deployment details. Avoid timestamps, UUIDs, large payloads, or unbounded queues unless correctness depends on them. Reduce the design to the smallest set of states and transitions that captures the real correctness risks.

### 1. System Goal

[One paragraph: what must the system do, focusing on correctness-critical aspects.]

### 2. Main Components

For each component/actor, list only what matters for correctness.

| Component | Responsibility | Key State (durable / volatile) | Visible Actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Name] | [Protocol-level role] | [State that matters for correctness] | [Messages, events, transitions] |
| [Name] | [Role] | [State] | [Actions] |

### 3. Abstract State

The minimum set of state variables needed to capture correctness. Flag anything likely to cause state explosion.

| Variable | Type (abstract) | Why Necessary | Explosion Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[var]` | [e.g., function Node → Status] | [Which property depends on this] | [low / medium / high] |
| `[var]` | [e.g., bounded sequence of Request] | [Why needed] | [risk] |

### 4. Key Actions / Transitions

| Action | Preconditions | State Updates | Failure / Interleaving Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Action name] | [What must be true] | [What changes] | [Can it fail partway? Concurrency-relevant?] |
| [Action name] | [Preconditions] | [Updates] | [Notes] |

### 5. Safety Properties

Invariants that TLC should check exhaustively. Write in crisp English translatable to TLA+.

- **[Property]**: [e.g., "No two nodes hold the lock simultaneously"]
- **[Property]**: [Invariant statement]

### 6. Liveness Assumptions

Progress properties and their fairness requirements.

- **[Property]**: [e.g., "Every submitted request is eventually processed or rejected"] — Fairness: [weak/strong on which actions]
- **[Property]**: [Statement] — Fairness: [assumption]

### 7. Simplifications Made for TLA+

| What Was Simplified | Why It Still Covers the Bugs We Care About |
|---|---|
| [Detail removed or bounded] | [Justification] |
| [Detail removed or bounded] | [Justification] |

## Global Execution Rules

These rules apply to every milestone without exception.

### 1) Stay inside scope

- Only change files listed in the current milestone unless a listed step explicitly requires one additional file.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not rename public APIs, commands, routes, events, persisted state shapes, or config keys unless the milestone explicitly says so.
- Do not introduce a new dependency unless the milestone explicitly allows it.
- Do not change database schema, file formats, or migration behavior unless the milestone explicitly includes migration work and migration tests.

### 2) Tests define the contract

- Write BDD tests before production code.
- Write E2E runtime validation stubs before production code.
- Confirm new tests fail for the right reason before implementing.
- A milestone is not done when code compiles. It is done when the declared contract is satisfied and evidence is recorded.

### 3) No placeholders in production paths

The following are not allowed unless explicitly permitted in the milestone:

- TODO or placeholder logic in production code
- silent fallbacks that hide errors
- swallowed errors without structured logging or user-visible handling
- fake implementations left in place after tests pass
- commented-out dead code
- temporary mocks in production paths
- hard-coded secrets, test keys, or unsafe defaults

### 4) Preserve backwards compatibility

Every milestone must explicitly verify that previously working user flows, commands, routes, persisted state, and public interfaces still work unless the milestone explicitly replaces them.

### 5) Prefer smallest safe change

- Prefer narrow, local modifications over broad rewrites.
- Prefer extending existing patterns over inventing new abstractions.
- Prefer deleting complexity over adding new layers.
- If a refactor is required, keep it minimal and directly justified by the milestone goal.

### 6) Record evidence, not claims

All meaningful checks must be recorded in the milestone Evidence Log:

- command run
- relevant file or test
- expected result
- actual result
- pass/fail
- notes

### 7) Keep .gitignore current and clean up test artifacts

- If a milestone introduces new build outputs, generated files, test fixtures, scratch directories, or tool-specific caches, add matching patterns to `.gitignore` before committing.
- Review `.gitignore` at the end of every milestone for staleness — remove patterns that no longer apply.
- Never commit test output data, temporary fixtures, scratch files, or generated artifacts to source control.
- Every test that creates files on disk must clean up after itself (use `tempdir`, `tempfile`, `afterEach` cleanup, or equivalent). Tests must not leave residual data in the working tree.
- Record the `.gitignore` review in the Evidence Log.

---

## Global Entry Rules (Pre-Milestone Protocol)

Do this before every milestone.

1. Read the lessons file from the previous milestone, if one exists. Apply any design corrections, naming rules, test strategy improvements, and failure-mode coverage it calls for before writing new code.
2. Read the current milestone fully: goal, context, contract block, out-of-scope block, file list, BDD scenarios, regression tests, E2E tests, smoke tests, and definition of done.
3. Run the full existing test suite and confirm it passes. Record the baseline in the Evidence Log.
   ```
   [backend test command]
   [frontend test command]
   ```
   If any tests fail before you start, stop and fix the baseline first. Do not begin a milestone on a red baseline.
4. Read the files listed in "Files Allowed To Change" and "Files To Read Before Changing Anything". Understand their current shape before editing.
5. Update the Milestone Tracker in this file: set the current milestone status to `in_progress` and record the Started date.
6. Create BDD test files first.
7. Create E2E runtime validation test stubs first.
8. Copy the milestone's Evidence Log template into working notes and begin filling it out as work happens.
9. Re-state the milestone constraints in your own words before coding:
   - goal
   - allowed files
   - forbidden changes
   - compatibility requirements
   - tests that must pass

---

## Global Exit Rules (Post-Milestone Protocol)

Do this after every milestone.

1. Run the full test suite. Every pre-existing test must still pass. Every new BDD scenario must pass.
   ```
   [backend test command]
   [frontend test command]
   ```
2. Run the milestone E2E runtime validation tests.
   ```
   [backend E2E test command]
   [frontend E2E test command]
   ```
3. Verify the app builds and boots to a usable state.
   ```
   [build/boot commands]
   ```
4. Run the smoke tests listed in the milestone. Check off each item in the runbook.
5. Verify backward compatibility for all items listed in the milestone Compatibility Checklist.
6. Complete the Self-Review Gate.
7. **Clean up test artifacts**: Verify no test output files, temporary fixtures, or generated data remain in the working tree. Run `git status` and confirm no untracked test artifacts exist.
8. **Review .gitignore**: Ensure any new build outputs, generated files, or tool caches introduced in this milestone have matching `.gitignore` patterns. Remove stale patterns that no longer apply.
9. Update ARCHITECTURE.md following the Documentation Update Table.
10. Update README.md if user-facing capabilities changed.
11. Write a lessons-learned file at `docs/slo/lessons/<prefix>-m<N>.md`.
12. Write a completion summary at `docs/slo/completion/<prefix>-m<N>.md`.
13. Update the Milestone Tracker in this file: set status to `done`, record Completed date, and fill in the lessons and completion summary paths.
14. Re-read the next milestone with fresh eyes and record any assumption changes in the lessons file.

## Background Context

### Current State

[Describe the current state of the system. What exists today? What works? List major subsystems and their capabilities. Be specific — reference file paths, module names, major entry points, and concrete data where relevant.]

### Problem

[List the specific gaps this runbook addresses. Number each gap and describe it concretely — reference specific code, UI behavior, test gaps, and user impact. Avoid vague generalities.]

1. **[Gap title]**: [Description referencing concrete code and behavior.]
2. **[Gap title]**: [Description.]

### Target Architecture

```
[ASCII diagram or description of the target end state after all milestones are complete.
Show major components, data flow, boundaries, persistence, and integration points.]
```

### Key Design Principles

These are system-wide rules the AI agent must follow when making implementation decisions.

1. **[Principle name]**: [Explanation.]
2. **[Principle name]**: [Explanation.]
3. **[Principle name]**: [Explanation.]

### What to Keep

Explicitly list existing subsystems, patterns, and code that must not be changed or broken.

- [Subsystem / module / pattern to preserve]
- [Subsystem / module / pattern to preserve]

### What to Change

List the specific files, modules, or behaviors that will be modified across milestones.

- **[File or module]** — [summary of change]
- **[File or module]** — [summary of change]

### Global Red Lines

These are forbidden unless explicitly overridden inside a milestone.

- No unrelated refactors
- No new dependencies
- No schema migrations
- No config key renames
- No public API/event/route renames
- No production placeholders
- No silent error swallowing
- No secrets in source control
- No test output data committed to source control

---

## BDD and Runtime Validation Rules

Every milestone follows these rules.

### Write Tests Before Production Code

For each milestone:
1. Read the BDD acceptance table.
2. Create the test file(s) first.
3. Confirm the tests fail for the expected reason.
4. Write production code to make the tests pass.
5. Re-run tests after any refactor.

### Required Test Coverage Categories

Every milestone must explicitly cover the categories that apply:

- happy path
- invalid input
- empty state / first-run state
- dependency failure / partial failure
- retry or rollback behavior if relevant
- concurrency or race behavior if relevant
- persistence / restore behavior if relevant
- backward compatibility behavior

If a category does not apply, state why.

### Scenario Structure

Every BDD scenario uses Given/When/Then:

```rust
#[test]
fn descriptive_test_name() {
    // Given: [precondition]
    // When: [action]
    // Then: [expected outcome]
}
```

```typescript
it("descriptive test name", () => {
  // Given: [precondition]
  // When: [action]
  // Then: [expected outcome]
});
```

### Test File Naming

| Layer | Convention | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Backend unit tests | `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside the source file | Same file as production code |
| Backend integration/BDD tests | `tests/<prefix>_<feature>.rs` | `src-tauri/tests/` (or equivalent) |
| Frontend unit tests | `<module>.test.ts` | Co-located with source file |
| Frontend page tests | `<Page>.test.tsx` | Co-located with component |
| Scenario/e2e tests | `tests/scenarios/<prefix>_scenario_<name>.rs` | `src-tauri/tests/scenarios/` (or equivalent) |
| E2E runtime validation (backend) | `tests/e2e_<prefix>_m<N>.rs` | `src-tauri/tests/` (or equivalent) |
| E2E runtime validation (frontend) | `e2e/<feature>.e2e.test.tsx` | `src/e2e/` |

### Test Artifact Cleanup Rules

Every test that creates files, directories, or temporary data on disk must follow these rules:

1. **Use temporary directories**: Prefer `tempdir()`, `tempfile::TempDir`, `tmp` from the test framework, or OS-provided temp locations. Never write test output into the source tree.
2. **Clean up on completion and failure**: Use RAII patterns (Rust `Drop`), `afterEach`/`afterAll` hooks (JS/TS), or `defer` statements to ensure cleanup runs even when tests fail.
3. **No residual state**: After the full test suite runs, `git status` must show no untracked files from test execution.
4. **Dedicated output directories**: If a test must write to a project-relative path (e.g., `output/`), that directory must be in `.gitignore` and tests must clean it between runs.
5. **CI parity**: Test cleanup behavior must be identical locally and in CI. Do not rely on CI ephemeral filesystems as an excuse to skip cleanup.

### End-to-End Runtime Validation

Every milestone must include E2E tests that go beyond compilation and verify that the system works correctly at runtime. These tests prove:

1. the app boots without errors
2. runtime contracts are met across IPC/API boundaries
3. BDD scenarios work at runtime, not just in isolation
4. there are no runtime panics, unhandled rejections, or silent failures
5. degraded states behave safely and visibly

### E2E Test Design Rules

1. Test runtime behavior, not just types.
2. Test the full stack where possible.
3. Test degraded and failure states, not just the happy path.
4. Assert against observable behavior.
5. Prefer at least one test that crosses the backend/frontend boundary when both layers changed.

---

## Dependency, Migration, and Refactor Policy

### Dependency policy

A new dependency is allowed only if the milestone explicitly includes:

- package/crate name
- why existing dependencies are insufficient
- security and maintenance rationale
- build/runtime cost rationale
- tests covering the new integration

### Migration policy

Any schema, config, or persisted-state change requires:

- migration plan
- backward compatibility strategy
- migration tests
- rollback strategy if relevant
- documentation updates

### Refactor budget

Each milestone must state one of the following:

- `No refactor permitted beyond direct implementation`
- `Minimal local refactor permitted in listed files only`
- `Targeted refactor permitted for [specific reason]`

---

## Evidence Log Template

Copy this table into each milestone section and fill it in during execution.

| Step | Command / Check | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline tests | `[command]` | all pre-existing tests green | | | |
| BDD tests created | `[files]` | compile or fail for expected reason | | | |
| E2E stubs created | `[files]` | compile or fail for expected reason | | | |
| Implementation | `[summary]` | contract satisfied | | | |
| Full tests | `[command]` | green | | | |
| E2E runtime | `[command]` | green | | | |
| Build/boot | `[command]` | boots cleanly | | | |
| Smoke tests | `[steps]` | all checked | | | |
| Test artifact cleanup | `git status` | no untracked test artifacts | | | |
| .gitignore review | review `.gitignore` | patterns current, no stale entries | | | |
| Compatibility checks | `[checks]` | no regressions | | | |

---

## Self-Review Gate

Before marking a milestone done, answer every question.

- Did I change only allowed files?
- Did I avoid unrelated refactors?
- Did I preserve all listed public interfaces and compatibility requirements?
- Did I add tests for failure modes, not just happy paths?
- Did I remove temporary debug code, mocks, placeholders, and commented-out dead code?
- Did I update documentation to match the implementation?
- Is every assumption either verified or explicitly documented as unresolved?
- Do all tests clean up their output artifacts? Does `git status` show a clean working tree?
- Is `.gitignore` up to date with any new generated files or build outputs?
- Is the milestone truly done according to its Definition of Done?

If any answer is "no", the milestone is not complete.
